# Class 2 - The Coder's Computer

## Four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. **code completion:** allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed, saving time and avoiding typos.  
2. **syntax highlighting:** takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text, thus making it easier to read and find typos. 
3. **variety of themes:**  themes allow modification of text editor background color, series of colors in text, and may affect other aspects of text editing software. For example may use darkbackground color in order to avoid eye fatigue and strain.
4. **healthy selection of extensions:** are like plugins for you text editor. Grants the ability to add functionality as needed.

## What do the following commands do?

* **pwd** - informs what the current or present working directory is.
* **ls** - lists the contents of the current directory.
* **cd** - means change directory and will usually be run with a single command line argument which is the location we would like to change into.
* **mkdir** - creates a new empty directory
* **touch** - creates new file

## What is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

* **cd projects** - change directory to the path where 'projects' is located.
* **mkdir new-project** - makes a new directory/folder within projects called 'new projects'
* **touch new-project/newfile.md** - creates a new file within 'new project' directory/folder called 'newfile.md'
* **cd ..** - change directory 'one level up' on the hierarchy of current directory location
* **ls projects/new-project** - lists the contents within 'projects/new-project' path.
