# Class 4 - Structure Web Pages with HTML

## What is HTML and why do we use it?

* *HTML (HyperText Markup Language)* \- it is the most basic building block of the Web.  it is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
* *HTML* consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
* Why do we use *HTML*? \- It allows us to connect web pages to one another using links (*Hypertext*), either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

An *HTML element* consists of an *opening tag, closing tag, and content*. Read below for a brief description of each.

1. **The opening tag:** consists of the name of the element *(example: 'p' element stands for paragraph)*, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets '<>'. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.  
2. **The closing tag:** is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a *forward slash* before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. **The content:**  is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

## What is it called when you give an element extra information?

It is called giving the *element* an ***attribute***. *Attributes* contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.  
**Example:** '*\<p class="editor note">My cat is grumpy\</p>*'  
In the example, *'class' is the attribute name* and *'editor-note' is the attribute value*.  
The *class attribute* allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. Some attributes have no value, such as required.  
Attributes that set a value always have:

1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

## What is a semantic element?

**Semantics:** refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example *"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?"*, or *"what purpose or role does that HTML element have"* (rather than *"what does it look like?"*).
