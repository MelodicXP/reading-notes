## What are variables in JavaScript?

*Variables* are containers for storing data (storing data values).

**Example:** *'x, y, and z,'* are variables, declared with the *'var'* keyword:

*Example below:  
var x = 5;  
var y = 6;  
var z = x + y;*  

## What does it mean to declare a variable?

Declaring a variable means that you are *'declaring'* what type of variable it is *(let, const, or var)*.

* *'Let'* - means that the variable can be changed.  
* *'Const'* - means the variable cannot be changed.
* *'Var'* - (used 1995 - 2015)  

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the *'let'* keyword:

*Example  
let x = 5;  
let y = 6;  
let z = x + y;*  

## What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

The equal sign *'(=)'* is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. It assigns a value to a declared variable.  
**Example:**  
*let x = 10;*  
*x = x + 5*  
In this example *'x'* is assigned the value of *'x + 5'* which means *'x'* is now holds the value of *'15'* (10 + 5).

**Note:** The "equal to" operator is written like *'=='* in JavaScript.

## What is information received from the user called?

*Input*, which is converted into binary information.
