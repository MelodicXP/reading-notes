# Class 7 - Programming with JavaScript

## What is control flow?

*Control flow* is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.  
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

## What is a JavaScript function?

A JavaScript *function* is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.  
**Example:**  
*// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2  
function myFunction(p1, p2) {  
return p1 \* p2;  
}*  
The above example returns the product of *p1* and *p2*.

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

It means code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
* Automatically (self invoked)

The *'( ) Operator'* invokes the function.  
**Note:** Accessing a function without *'( )'* will return the function object instead of the function result.

## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

As mentioned in the previous question, the parenthesis *'( ) Operator'* invokes the function.  
It also serves as an area to input parameters that you would like the function to utlize in the execution of the function's code.
