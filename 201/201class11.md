# 201 - Class 11  - Audio and Video in HTML; Domain Modeling Revisited

## Video and Audio Content

1. **Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**  
The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions \<video> and \<audio> elements and the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.

2. **Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the \<video> element**  

    * **src attribute:** In the same way as for the \<img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

    * **controls attribute:** Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

3. **Why is it important to have fallback content inside the \<video> element?**  
Fallback content is displayed if browser accessing the page doesn't support the \<video> element, allowing for a fallback for older browsers. A fallback can be a direct link to video file, so user can access it some way regardless of browser being used.

4. **Write a very short story where \<audio> and \<video> are characters.**  
There once was character named Audio that could showcase amazing sounds to those around him but could never visually express himself and put images to the sounds he created.  Then one day he heard of a person named Video and how she had the ability to create beautiful images for others to enjoy.  What Audio didn't know is that Video longed to be able to add beautiful sounds to enhance the impact of her visual images.  Upon learning about Video, Audio decided to go and meet this interesting person.  Once they met they knew they were exactly what the other was missing.  So together they went off and journeyed the internet adding their audio and visual elements to the websites of the world so that others could enjoy them!

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. **How does Grid layout differ from Flex?**  
CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid” or “CSS Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system.  Flexbox is a one-directional system.  

2. **Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.**  

    * **grid-container:** element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items.

    * **grid items:** children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.

    * **grid line:**  dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column.

## Responsive Images

1. **Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?**  
    * Helps to improve performance across different devices such as on mobile devices with limited bandwidth as the file size and load times can reduced by using appropriately sized images.  
    * Users can view images without image being cropped. Responsive images scale with the size of the window user has.  
    * For accessiblity.  Users may use screen readers and by providing alt text, visually impared users can understand the meaning of the images.

2. **Define the following \<img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.**  
    * **srcset:** defines the set of images browser allowed to choose between, and what size each image is.

    * **sizes:** defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true.

    **Example:**

    ```javascript
    <img
    srcset="elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
    sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px,
            800px"
    src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg"
    alt="Elva dressed as a fairy" />
    ```  

3. **How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?**  
'srcset' offers a more efficient solution for responsive images, providing automatic selection, bandwidth optimization, improved performance, and better browser compatibility compared to CSS or JavaScript.
