# 201 - Class 12 - Canvas and ChartJS

## JavaScript Canvas

1. **What does the \<canvas> allow a developer to acheive?**  
Allows developer to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript

2. **What is the importance of the closing \</canvas> tag?**  
Requires an opening and closing tag because it is a container to hold fallback content.  Fallback content will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the \<canvas> element.  The fallback content can be any content that is placed between the open and closing tags such as text, images, or other HTML elements (for example a \<p> element that displays text such as 'browswer does not support this content').

3. **Explain what the getContext() method does.**  
It is a method that that returns a render context object. The getContext() takes one argument which is the type of context (such as '2d' to get a 2D rendering context object).  The 2D rendering context allows to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.

## Chart.js Documentation

1. **What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?**  
It allows for the creation of interactive charts and graphs on web pages such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.  It can be brought into projects by using the script tag and adding it to the head or body section along with the src inside the script tag. **Example:**  

    ``` javasript
    <script src="path/to/chartjs/dist/chart.umd.js"></script>
    <script>
        const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {...});
    </script>
    ```

## Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

1. **What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?**  
    * Charts provide a visual representation of data, making it easier to understand complext data.
    * A chart can summarize large amounts of data in to a visual form so that key insights can be without having to go through a table.  
    * More visually appealing as different colors, labels, and formating can enhance the presentation of data.

2. **How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**  
It would assist the pior lab project we worked such as salmon cookies and the odd-duck product voting.  Instead of presenting a table for salmon cookies, a bar graph can be shown to present which stores are selling the most cookies per hour/per day.  For the odd duck product voting a pie chart could be shown to visually display which product had the most votes, as well as a pie chart showing which product had the most views.
