## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. **What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**  
Ability to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted. It allows for the addition of motion and interactivity to elements. With transtion smooth and gradual changes can be applied to an element's properties over a specified duration.

2. **How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**  
_Animations_ allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. _Transitions_ provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
