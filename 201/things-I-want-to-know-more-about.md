# Things I want to know more about

## Class 14 - Psychological Safety

### Why this topic matters as it relates to what I'm studying

 Due to the complex nature of software development, having a psychologically safe environement allows developers to feel comfortable asking questions and taking risks without the fear of judgment.  This approach promotes a growth mindset.  It allows for more collaboration with others and trust to share roadblocks openly.  By having psychological safety at the fore-front it enables developers to approach challenges confidently and more creatively as they are willing to take more risk in expression.

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
    1. Open communication and dialogue - an environment where individuals feel comfortable sharing with one another without the fear of judgment or ridicule.
    2. Leadership that promotes collaboration - leadership that sets the 'norms' as one which is inclusive, collaborative, and promotes respect and open communication.
    3. Build trust and respect - creates a work environment where individuals feel safe to be authentic.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
In my current place of work, when we have meetings we promote collaboration, expression, and feedback.  We proceed through the topics, at each topic we ask for feedback and encourage participatio.  There are no 'wrong' answers, its okay to speak.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
    1. Increased creativity - without the fear of judgment team members can freely share innovative ideas which leads to new solutions.
    2. Higher employee satisfaction - when employees feel safe to express, the likelihood of motivation and satisfaction increases, which can result in increased productivity.
    3. Promotes growth - a safe environment allows team members to take risk and learn from failures without the fear of ridicule.  This allows for growth and skill acquisition of the individuals/team members, which ultimately benefits the team and company.
