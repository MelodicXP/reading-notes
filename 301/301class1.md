# 301 - Class 1 - Introduction to React and Components

## Why this topic matters  

  This topic matters is it will expose me to the fundamental concepts about React, specfically as relates to components.

## Component Based Architecture

1. **What is a “component”?**  

    A component is a self-contained unit of software that holds specific functions, interacts with other components through clear interfaces, and can be reused and combined by different parties, offering a modular approach to building software systems. It has a well-defined interface, can stand alone, and can be combined with other components.  

2. **What are the characteristics of a component?**  

    Components have certain characteristics: they're designed to be reused and possibly replaced, they work in various environments, they can be extended for new behavior, they maintain clear interfaces while hiding internal details, and they strive to be independent with minimal dependencies on other components.  

3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**  

    Component-oriented software design offers advantages over traditional object-oriented approaches, including reduced development time and costs through component reuse, as well as improved reliability by utilizing existing components.

    It simplifies deployment and version updates, reduces costs by using third-party components, makes development easier by using defined functionality, promotes reusability across applications, enhances system reliability, allows for easy maintenance and updates without affecting the whole system, and fosters independent development and flexible connections among components for increased productivity.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

1. **What is “props” short for?**

    Properties

2. **How are props used in React?**

    Props are used to pass data from one component to another as read-only data.  

3. **What is the flow of props?**  

    Uni-directional from parent to child to grandchild (and so on…).
