## Why this topic matters  

  This topic matters as it will provide a deeper understanding of the order of how functions are being called and executed.

## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. **What is a 'call'?**  

   In JavaScript, a "call" refers to the invocation of a function. When a function is called, it gets added to a structure known as the "Call Stack." This stack keeps track of what functions are currently being run and what needs to be run next.
  
2. **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**

   The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.  
   However, JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations without blocking the stack. These tasks are offloaded elsewhere and come back when they're done, but they don't tie up the stack while waiting.

3. **What does LIFO mean?**

    Last In, First Out. In the context of the JavaScript Call Stack, LIFO means the last function that got called (added to the stack) is the first one to be executed and removed from the stack.

4. **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack**

    1. main() - The main function that initiates everything.
    2. calculate() - A function that performs some calculations.
    3. fetchData() - A function that fetches data.
    4. parseData() - A function that parses the fetched data.  

    First execute main(), then calculate(), and so on. After each function has executed, put calls back one by one in reverse order.

    ``` javascript

        Initial state:
        [ Empty Stack ]

        Step 1: main() is called
        [ main ]

        Step 2: main() calls calculate()
        [ calculate, main ]

        Step 3: calculate() calls fetchData()
        [ fetchData, calculate, main ]

        Step 4: fetchData() calls parseData()
        [ parseData, fetchData, calculate, main ]

        Step 5: parseData() finishes and is removed from the stack
        [ fetchData, calculate, main ]

        Step 6: fetchData() finishes and is removed from the stack
        [ calculate, main ]

        Step 7: calculate() finishes and is removed from the stack
        [ main ]

        Step 8: main() finishes and is removed from the stack
        [ Empty Stack ]

    ```

5. **What causes a Stack Overflow?**

    A Stack Overflow happens when the Call Stack gets filled up beyond its capacity. This usually occurs when you have functions that call themselves recursively without a proper exit condition. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error. To avoid this, always make sure your recursive functions have a clear base case or exit condition.

## JavaScript error message

1. **What is a ‘reference error’?**  

     It occurs when try to access variable or function that hasn't been declared yet.  

2. **What is a ‘syntax error’?**  

    Occurs when code is written that JavaScript engine can't understand because it doesn't follow the language's rules and structure.  

3. **What is a ‘range error’?**  

    Occurs when trying to pass a value as an argument or operate on a variable in a way that's outside of allowable range of values. An example in JavaScript trying to set an array to have a negative length.  

4. **What is a ‘type error’?**  

    Occurs when trying to perform an operation on a value whose type doesn't support that operation. An example is trying to treat a number as a string, or calling a function on undefined or null.  

5. **What is a breakpoint?**  

    A breakpoint is a designated spot in code where debugger in instructed to pause execution. When code hits a breakpoint, it provides an opportunity to inspect variables, step through functions, and explore how your code is running in that specific moment.  

6. **What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

    Acts like a programmable breakpoint. The code execution will pause at breakpoint if developer console is open, allowing inspection of variables, step through code, and assess. Also need to remember to remove or comment out the debugger statement once ready for production.
