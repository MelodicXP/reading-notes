## nosql vs sql

### SQL

  1. **Structured schema:** Requires a predefined schema and data structure.
  2. **Table-based:** Data is stored in rows and columns, much like spreadsheets.
  3. **Scalability:** Traditionally scaled by increasing the horsepower of the hardware (vertical scaling).
  4. **ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability):** Strict transactional consistency.
  5. **Complex queries:** Strong support for complex queries with JOIN operations and subqueries.

### NoSQL

  1. **Dynamic schema:** Allows for the insertion of data without a predefined schema.
  2. **Various data models:** Can store key-value, wide-column, graph-based, or document-oriented data.
  3. **Scalability:** Designed to scale out by distributing data across many servers (horizontal scaling).
  4. **Eventual consistency:** Focuses on availability and partition tolerance, with eventual data consistency.
  5. **Query simplicity:** Often requires simpler queries, although some NoSQL databases like MongoDB support complex querying.

      1. **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**  

          **Structured Data with Relationships:** SQL is great when data is structured and has clear relationships. Think of scenarios with customers, orders, and products, where everything fits neatly into tables with rows and columns.  

          **Complex Queries:** SQL databases are powerful in handling complex queries with joins and subqueries.  

          **Data Integrity:** SQL databases are good at maintaining strict data integrity through defined schemas.  

          **Reporting and Analysis:** SQL databases provide robust tools for reporting and analysis.  

          SQL databases are ideal for cases where the structure of the data is known in advance, consistency and accuracy are paramount, and the data relationships are complex.

      2. **Give a real world example**.  

          **Inventory Management:** A bookstore business has books, which are inventory. Each book has attributes like ISBN, title, author, genre, price, and stock quantity. The details are structured and consistent, fitting perfectly into a table format that an SQL database can manage efficiently.  

      3. **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**  

          **Unstructured or Semi-structured Data:** If data comes in various formats (like different art pieces)—text, videos, blog posts, user-generated content—NoSQL can handle this non-uniform data well.

          **Rapid Development:** NoSQL's flexible schema allows data model to evolve on the fly without the need to predefine it.

          **Scalability:**  NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by distributing the load across many servers.

          **Big Data:** NoSQL can manage massive volumes of data that are often read and written at high speeds.

          **Variable Workloads:** NoSQL databases can handle variable workloads with their distributed architecture.

          NoSQL is the go-to for situations where data is diverse, the structure is not rigid, and rapid growth and high throughput are desired.  

      4. **Give a real world example.**

          A social media platform, where users post text updates, share photos, stream videos, and connect with others in a web of relationships. The data is diverse and the interactions complex. NoSQL databases can efficiently store user profiles (documents), friends lists (graphs), and content feeds (key-value or wide-column stores), all while scaling to accommodate millions of users interacting in real-time.  

      5. **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**  

          NoSQL databases—especially document and graph databases—are often better suited for this task due to their flexible data models and powerful relationship traversal capabilities. They provide a more intuitive and performant way of managing hierarchical data, similar to how an artist might naturally sketch a tree with branches, rather than trying to fit it into a grid.  

          NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data).

      6. **Which type of database is best for scalability?**  

          NoSQL databases generally take the lead. NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by distributing the data across many servers or nodes in a cluster. NoSQL databases, with their schema-less design, allow you to incorporate new data types and sources without the need to alter a central database schema. Many NoSQL systems are built from the ground up to operate in a distributed fashion, which is ideal for cloud-based systems that span across multiple data centers.

  1. **What does SQL stand for?**  

      SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

  2. **What is a relational database?**  

      Type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. In a relational database, each table has columns and rows. Each column represents a different attribute of the data, and each row corresponds to a specific record.  Data in different tables can be related based on key columns, and these relationships enable the relational database to retrieve and assemble information from different tables efficiently.  

  3. **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**  

      A relational database works with a tabular structure, where data is organized into tables, much like spreadsheets. These tables are called relations.  Each table is made up of rows and columns.  

  4. **What is a ‘schema’?**  

      A schema is like a blueprint or an architectural plan. It defines the shape and organization of data within the database, much like how an architect’s plan specifies the layout and structure of a building.

  5. **What is a NoSQL database?**  

      A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL databases are particularly tailored for specific data models and have flexible schemas that allow programmers to create and manage modern applications.

  6. **How does it work?**  

      NoSQL databases work by storing data in ways that are optimized for specific requirements and not necessarily in strictly structured tables like SQL databases.   They often don't require a fixed schema, they can handle different types of data in different ways, and they allow for the easy addition of new data types and sources.  NoSQL databases often support horizontal scaling, meaning they can handle more data simply by adding more servers to the database.

  7. **What is inside of a MongoDB database?**  

      When working with a MongoDB database, primarily working with documents and collections, reading and writing data that resembles JSON objects but with the enhanced capabilities of BSON.

  8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.  

      MongoDB is generally considered more flexible than traditional SQL databases for several reasons such as dynamic schema, data representation, horizontal scaling, and development speed.  

      However, this flexibility comes with trade-offs. MongoDB's flexibility can lead to data redundancy and inconsistencies if not carefully managed.

  9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

      **Data redundancy:** NoSQL databases often store the same piece of data in multiple places to improve read performance, which can lead to data redundancy and the need for more storage space.  

      **Complex querying:** Does not offer same level of query sophistication as SQL databases making queries more difficult or less efficient to perform.  

      **Standardization:**  Unlike SQL, which is a standardized language for querying relational databases, NoSQL databases lack a standard query language. Each NoSQL database can have its own language and APIs, which can lead to a steep learning curve and make it more difficult to find experienced developers.  

      **Data Integrity:** The flexible schema of NoSQL databases means they lack the enforced integrity constraints of SQL databases. While this can be beneficial for speed and development, it can also lead to inconsistent or incorrect data if the application does not correctly manage data integrity.
