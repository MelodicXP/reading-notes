# 301 - Class 13 - More CRUD

## Why this topic matters  

  This topic matters as it we will most likely be working with http status codes when building our databases.

## CRUD Basics

1. **Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?**  

    To update a record through an API, you would typically use the PUT or PATCH HTTP methods. The choice between these two depends on how you intend to handle the update.  

    PUT: This method is used for updating a resource completely.  

    PATCH: This method is used for partial updates to a resource. Unlike PUT, with PATCH, you only send the specific data you want to update.

2. **Which REST methods require an ID parameter?**

    PUT: Updates a specific resource by its ID. For instance, PUT /users/123 would update the user with the ID 123.

    PATCH: Partially updates a specific resource identified by its ID, similar to PUT. For example, PATCH /users/123 would partially update the user with the ID 123.

    DELETE: Removes a specific resource by its ID. For example, DELETE /users/123 would delete the user with the ID 123.

1. **Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?**  

    Ability to map CRUD to REST.  

    The four CRUD operations map neatly to HTTP methods used in RESTful services:
    * Create corresponds to POST. You use POST requests to create new resources.
    * Read corresponds to GET. You use GET requests to read or retrieve resources.
    * Update corresponds to PUT or PATCH. You use PUT requests to update existing resources completely and PATCH for partial updates.
    * Delete corresponds to DELETE. You use DELETE requests to remove resources.  

    CRUD refers to the fundamental operations performed on data, REST is a way of structuring applications to handle these operations over a network using standard HTTP methods.  

2. **If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**  

    1. Define Data Model by identifying the resources (like users, products, orders) and their relationships.
    2. Design Resource Endpoints (URI structure - '/users', '/users/123')
    3. Define Operations using HTTP Methods - POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
    4. Implement request handling on server-side to handle request like connnecting to database, executing CRUD operations, and handling errors.
    5. Test API behaviors to ensure behaves as expected.
