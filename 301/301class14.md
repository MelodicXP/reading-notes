## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?  

    The decline of women in the computer science field is linked to the rise of personal computers in U.S. homes, which were primarily marketed to men and boys, reinforcing the stereotype that computers are for boys. This gendered marketing influenced popular culture in the 1980s, as seen in movies where male geeks triumph using technology. In the 1990s, research showed that even interested girls were less likely to receive computers at home, putting them at a disadvantage in computer science education, as professors assumed all students had prior experience with computers.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?  

    The fact that males had been playing with computers from a young age matters because it gave them a significant head start in computer science education.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?  

    Diversity efforts are most successful when they are driven by a strong business rationale and a commitment to creating an inclusive environment. Success requires a strategy for building a diverse, inclusive company, along with an accountability plan to ensure the effectiveness of this strategy. Leaders who believe in the importance of cultivating an inclusive tech community and recognize the business benefits of diversity tend to drive the most successful diversity efforts.  

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?  

    Diverse companies perform better because diverse teams bring a variety of perspectives, leading to more creativity and innovation. This diversity in thought and experience often results in smarter and more creative solutions to problems. Research has shown a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes, with diverse teams being linked to better company performance, including increases in firm value and financial performance, particularly in innovation-focused sectors.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.  

  YouTubeâ€™s experience serves as an example. When its predominantly right-handed developer team overlooked the perspective of left-handed users while building the iOS app, a significant portion of videos (5% to 10%) were uploaded upside down. This oversight highlights how a more diverse team, representing a broader range of user experiences, can build more effectively for diverse user groups.
