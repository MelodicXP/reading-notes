# 301 - Class 15 - Authentication

## Why this topic matters  

  This topic matters as it we will most likely be working with http status codes when building our databases.

## What is OAuth

1. **What is OAuth?**  

    OAuth allows websites and services to share assets among users. OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.  
    OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites without giving them the passwords. This protocol allows third-party services to use user information from a platform (like Facebook or Google) to provide a seamless integration or login experience without exposing the user's sensitive credentials.

2. **Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.**  

    The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.  

3. **How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?**

    **How OAuth works**  

    Let’s assume a user has already signed into one website or service (OAuth only works using HTTPS). The user then initiates a feature/transaction that needs to access another unrelated site or service. The following happens (greatly simplified):

    1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
    2. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
    3. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
    4. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
    5. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
    6. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
    7. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
    8. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
    9. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
    10. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
    11. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.
    12. OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

4. What is OpenID?  

    OpenID is an authentication protocol that allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites (known as Relying Parties, or RP) using a third-party service, simplifying the login process for websites and applications.  
    Unlike OAuth, which is primarily focused on authorization, OpenID is used for authentication (verifying a user's identity).  

    When a user tries to access a service requiring authentication, they can choose to log in via an OpenID provider (such as Google or Facebook). The user proves their identity to the OpenID provider and then is redirected back to the original service, which trusts the information provided by the OpenID provider. This process allows users to log in to multiple websites or applications without needing to create new accounts and passwords for each, using a single set of credentials managed by their chosen OpenID provider.

## Authorization and Authentication flows

1. **What is the difference between authorization and authentication?**  

    In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

    **Authentication:**

    * Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It involves confirming that someone is who they claim to be.
    * This usually involves credentials like usernames and passwords, biometric data, one-time passcodes, or digital certificates.
    * For example, when you log in to your email account, the service checks if your username and password are correct – this is authentication.  

    **Authorization:**

    * Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.
    * It happens after authentication and determines the permissions and access levels granted to the authenticated user or entity.
    * For example, in a workplace, while all employees may authenticate with their company ID, not all will have the authorization to access sensitive financial data.

2. **What is Authorization Code Flow?**

    Authorization Code Flow is a process used in OAuth 2.0, a protocol for authorization, to grant an application access to protected resources without exposing user credentials (like passwords) to the application.  

    This flow ensures that the access token is never exposed directly to the user's browser, adding an extra layer of security. It's widely used in web applications where the confidentiality of the client secret can be maintained.

3. **What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?**  

    Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced "pixy") is an extension of the traditional OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow. It is designed to enhance security for public clients, like mobile and single-page applications, where the client secret cannot be securely stored.

    PKCE adds an additional layer of security to mitigate the risk of the authorization code being intercepted and misused.  

    PKCE effectively prevents the misuse of an intercepted authorization code because without the corresponding code verifier, the code cannot be exchanged for an access token. This makes it particularly useful for applications running in environments where storing client secrets is not feasible or secure.

4. **What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?**

    Implicit Flow with Form Post is a variation of the Implicit Grant type in OAuth 2.0, tailored for applications where the access token is returned immediately without an extra authorization code exchange step. It's primarily used by client-side applications, like JavaScript SPAs (Single Page Applications), where the application cannot securely store a client secret.

    In the traditional Implicit Flow, the access token is returned directly in the redirection URI after the user authorizes the application. However, this can pose security risks as the token might be exposed in browser history or logs.

    The Implicit Flow with Form Post mitigates this risk by returning the token as the response to an HTTP POST transaction, instead of in the URI.

    While this method is more secure than the standard Implicit Flow, it's important to note that the Implicit Flow itself (including with Form Post) is less recommended nowadays due to inherent security weaknesses. The OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice document discourages its use in favor of the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, which provides better security guarantees, especially for public clients like SPAs and mobile apps.

5. **What is Client Credentials Flow?**  

    Client Credentials Flow is a grant type in OAuth 2.0, primarily used for server-to-server communication where the application acts on its own behalf, rather than on behalf of an individual user. This flow is suitable for scenarios where an application needs to access its own resources or services securely, and no user context is involved.

6. **What is Device Authorization Flow?**  

    Device Authorization Flow, also known as the Device Code Flow, is a grant type in OAuth 2.0 designed for devices that either do not have a browser or have limited input capabilities. This flow is commonly used in scenarios like smart TVs, printers, or IoT devices, where traditional web-based authorization flows are impractical.  

    This flow is beneficial because it decouples the device from the user’s authentication process, making it suitable for scenarios where the device lacks a convenient input method or web browsing capability.

7. **What is Resource Owner Password Flow?**  

    The Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow, often referred to as the Password Flow, is one of the grant types defined in OAuth 2.0. It is a straightforward flow but considered less secure compared to other OAuth 2.0 flows.  

    This flow is generally used when other flows like Authorization Code Flow can't be used, typically in scenarios where the client application is highly trusted with user credentials, such as applications developed by the same company that hosts the resource server. However, due to the sensitive nature of handling user credentials directly, it's recommended to use more secure flows like Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, especially for third-party clients.

    It's important to note that exposing user credentials to the client application increases security risks, and this flow should be used cautiously, ensuring secure handling and transmission of the credentials.
