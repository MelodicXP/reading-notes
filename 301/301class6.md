# 301 - Class 6 - Async Code and 3rd Party API

## Why this topic matters  

  These topics matters is they covers the importance of psychological safety in the work place which leads to better team work and the importance/usefulness of using universal 'verbs' and 'nouns' so that all machines can talk to each other.

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. **To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**  

    Psychological safety is a crucial to a successful work environment.  In my prior (and current) work exprience it allows for smoother and more effective teamwork as everyone has an opportunity to express themselves without fear of ridicule and contribute ideas and advice on how we can improve our operations and procedures.  I agree with the message of the article that a successful team is not merely based on each individual's performance, but also heavily relies on how well team members can communicate, empathize, and operate in an environment of trust and psychological safety.  
  
2. **How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**  

    We all want to feel comfortable and have psychological safety.  This article serves as a reminder to me to help foster/promote a safe environment for my current and future projects.  By doing this team members will be served as it promotes a safe environemnt in which suggestions for improvement are taken into consideration and team members are able to openly express themselves in authentic manner.

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**  

    Roy Fielding is a computer scientist who played a significant role in the development of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.  

2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

    We are not all not using the same 'nouns' and 'verbs' (language) such as GET, POST, and PATCH, meaning all the information is not consumable in a standard way.  

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**  

   HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. **What does a GET do?**  

   A GET request in HTTP is like asking for information from a web server. It's similar to going to a library and requesting a specific book from the librarian.
  
5. **What does a POST do?**  

    A POST request in HTTP is like sending a letter or a package to a recipient. It's used to submit data to a web server, typically to create or update information on the server.

6. **What does PUT do?**

    When you use a PUT request, it's like taking a book from your collection and placing it on a specific slot on the shelf. If there's already a book in that slot, the old one is replaced with the new book.

7. **What does PATCH do?**

   A PATCH request in HTTP is like making a small, specific change to an existing resource without replacing the entire resource. It's used to apply partial modifications to a resource. Its like a piece of paper with a drawing on it, and you want to make a small correction to that drawing. Instead of erasing the entire drawing and starting over (which would be similar to a PUT request), you use a PATCH request. It's like placing a small, adhesive sticker over the part of the drawing you want to change or fix. The sticker contains the updated information, and you apply it precisely to the area that needs modification.
