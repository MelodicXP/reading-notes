# 301 - Class 7 - Node.js

## Why this topic matters  

  This topic matters as it allows for the use of Node.js for the development of fast and responsive web applications, and the use of npm to install from a wide selection of useful tools.

1. **What is Node.js?**  

    Node.js is a tool that lets computer multitask and handle many things at once, allowing for fast and responsive web applications to be built.  The creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods. Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.
  
2. **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

    It's like having a super-smart translator for web pages in these browsers. Instead of taking its time to understand JavaScript, V8 quickly turns it into a language that your computer can understand and use, making web pages load and work faster.

3. **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

    It can run JavaScript code for various purposes, not just on web pages. It provides a flexible and adaptable stage for running JavaScript code outside the web browser environment, allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks.

4. **What is npm?**

    npm is a tool that acts like a specialized store for JavaScript code and tools. It simplifies the process of finding, installing, and managing these pieces of code, making it easier for developers to build software efficiently.

5. **What version of node are you running on your machine?**

    v19.7.0

6. **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

    9.5.0

7. **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

    npm install jshint

8. **What is node used for?**

    Running varous build tools primarily focused on building server-side applications applications and networked applications. It is used to develop a wide range of applications, especially those requiring high concurrency, real-time capabilities, and non-blocking I/O.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**  

    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness

2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

    Greater efficiency - As we are self-paced, the exposure I've had with faculty to assist me in my code has helped improve my efficiency with getting my code done at faster as my mistakes are caught and suggestions are made to improve the code.

3. **How does pair programming work?**  

    Pair programming involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the one actively typing and handling coding tasks, while the Navigator provides guidance, thinks about the overall strategy, and checks for errors without directly inputting code. The Navigator can also use their computer for research but doesn't write code.
