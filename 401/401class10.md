# 401 - Class 10 - Stacks and Queues

## Why This Topic Matters  

Stacks and Queues are foundational for structuring data and algorithms in computing. They provide structure and order to the way data is accessed, processed, and stored.

## Analogies - The Queue (enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, peek)

**Scenario:** Imagine you're at the most eagerly awaited concert of the year, featuring your favorite band. The venue is a massive stadium, and the entry is through a single grand doorway. Here, the concept of a queue comes into play.

### The Queue Terms - Analogies using a concert

**Enqueue:** This is every time a new fan arrives and joins the end of the line. In queue terminology, they've just been "enqueued" - added to the back of the queue.

**Dequeue:** The moment the doors open and the first fan in line steps inside, they've been "dequeued." They've left the queue to enter the concert hall.

**Front:** The fan at the very beginning of the line is at the "front" of the queue. They're the next one to step into the concert.

**Rear:** Far back, at the end of the line, the last fan who's just joined the queue stands at the "rear."

**Peek:** Imagine if you could zip to the front of the line to check who's about to enter next, then zip back to your spot. That's "peeking" - taking a quick look at who's at the front of the queue without changing the order of the line.

**IsEmpty:** There comes a moment when no one's left waiting outside. The queue is "empty," and everyone's inside.

#### FIFO & LILO

**FIFO (First In, First Out)** governs the line. The fan who arrived first, will be the first to enter. .

**LILO (Last In, Last Out):** though seemingly similar, is just another way to understand that the last fan to join the line will be the last to find their way inside.
