# 401 - Class 11 - Event Driven Programming

## Why This Topic Matters  

  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a critical component of managing user permissions and access control within any organization.

## Event Driven Programming

1. **What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**  
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.  

2. **What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**  

    - **OOP:** Promotes the design of modular and encapsulated components (objects/classes) with well-defined interfaces, making your code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.
    - **EDP Integration:** When these objects emit or listen for events, it allows for loose coupling between components. Objects don't need to directly invoke methods on each other; instead, they can communicate through events. This enhances modularity as you can easily add, remove, or modify objects without affecting the overall system.

3. **Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

    Imagine you're organizing a big concert with lots of bands (your web application). Now, think of Event-Driven Programming (EDP) as the way you manage all the different things that need to happen at the concert. In the context of a web browser (the front end), it's like handling requests from the audience. Someone raises their hand (clicks a button), and you respond by playing their favorite song (showing them a webpage or sending data).

    Now, let's take this concept backstage to where all the behind-the-scenes magic happens – that's the backend, like using Node.js, which is a popular way to write server-side code.

    **Handling Multiple Requests:** Imagine hundreds of fans shouting song requests at once. In a traditional setup, you might try to answer each request one by one. But with EDP, it's like having a system where each request is a note in a song. Node.js can handle many notes at the same time, playing them in harmony without getting overwhelmed.

    **Efficiency and Speed:** Instead of waiting for each band member to finish their part before moving on to the next song (synchronous), EDP allows everyone to play their parts whenever they're ready (asynchronous). This means the concert keeps flowing smoothly, and there's no awkward silence between songs.

    **Flexibility:** Say you suddenly decide to add a fireworks show when a particular song is played. With EDP, adding this new "event" is easy. You just need to prepare the fireworks (write a bit of code) to trigger whenever that song starts, without disrupting the rest of the concert.

    **Scalability:** As your concert grows bigger, with more bands and more audience requests, EDP makes it easier to expand. Whether it's handling more song requests or adding new features (like food delivery to the audience), you can do so efficiently because each part of your system is ready to respond to specific events, rather than being stuck in a rigid, step-by-step process.

## Additional Questions

1. **Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**  
I look forward learning about trees.  I am not familiar with that concept as of yet.

2. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**  
To gain knowledge and improve coding skills so that the code I write is more refined, readable, simple, and neat as time progresses.
