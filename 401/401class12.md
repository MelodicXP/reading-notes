# 401 - Class 12 - Socket.io

## Why This Topic Matters  

It allows real-time communication between web clients and servers, making it possible for information to be exchanged instantly without needing to refresh the web page. This is key for applications such as live chat systems, online multiplayer games, and collaborative platforms, where immediate user interaction and data synchronization are essential. Moreover, Socket.IO provides a robust solution for handling complex networking features like fallbacks for different browser support and automatic reconnections, enhancing user experience and reliability in dynamic web applications.

## Web Sockets

1. **What is a Web Socket?**  
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing simultaneous two-way communication channels over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.  
Once a connection is established, the server and client can send data back and forth without having to re-establish the connection for each exchange. This is great for real-time applications like live chat systems, online gaming, or when you need to update a web page with live data without refreshing the page.

2. **Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established**  

    - **Initial HTTP Request (Client to Server)**  
    Upgrade Request: The client initiates by sending a standard HTTP request to the server with an Upgrade header indicating the request to switch protocols from HTTP to WebSocket.

    - **Server Response (Server to Client):**  
    HTTP 101 Switching Protocols Response: If the server supports WebSockets and accepts the connection request, it responds with a status code 101 indicating that protocols are switching.  

   Once the handshake is successfully completed, the connection is open and fully operational. Now, the communication protocol is no longer HTTP but WebSocket, operating over the same underlying TCP/IP connection.

3. **Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.**  
Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a request from that client. This capability is essential for real-time communication, as it allows the server to push updates immediately as they become available, without needing to wait for the client to ask for it.

## Socket.io Tutorial

1. **What does the event handler io.on() do?**  
Enables to listen for and respond to events. It's used to register event handlers that can react to specific activities or messages from the client side.

2. **Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected**

    Implementing client-side confirmations using callbacks can provide proof that messages are not only sent but also received and processed by the client.

    ``` javascript
      // Server-side
    socket.emit('question', 'How are you?', function(response) {
        console.log('Acknowledgement received:', response);
    });

    // Client-side
    socket.on('question', function(msg, callback) {
        console.log('Server asks:', msg);
        callback('I am fine, thank you!');
    });
    ```

3. **What does socket.emit() do?**  
The socket.emit() function in Socket.IO is all about sending messages. It’s one of the core methods used to communicate between the server and client, allowing for real-time data transfer in applications.  
The socket.emit() method sends a message to the socket instance it is called on. If you call it on the server side, it sends a message to a particular client connected to that socket. Conversely, if used on the client side, it sends a message to the server.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

1. **What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).**  

    - **WebSocket:** is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection; WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. When clients trigger the request to the server, it does not close the connection on receiving the response; it rather persists and waits for the Client or server to terminate the request.

      - A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels.
      - Part of the HTML5 standard and implemented natively in web browsers.
      - Requires both the client and server to implement the protocol to establish a connection.

    - **Socket.IO:** is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface.

      - A JavaScript library (for both server and client) that aims to make real-time communication easier.
      - Works on top of WebSocket but can fall back to other methods of communication if needed.
      - Provides a high-level API with features like rooms, namespaces, and automatic reconnection, which are not part of the WebSocket API.
      - Client-Side: it is the library that runs inside the browser
      - Server Side: It is the library for Node.js

2. **When would you use Socket.IO?**  
  Socket.IO is particularly useful when you need robust handling of various real-time web features, fallback options, or when dealing with applications requiring complex client-server interactions. It abstracts away many of the complications involved in direct WebSocket programming, allowing you to focus more on the functionality of your application rather than the underlying transport mechanism.  

3. **When would you use WebSockets?**  
  Opt for WebSockets when you need a robust, low-latency communication channel and when the additional features provided by libraries like Socket.IO (e.g., automatic fallbacks, room management) are not necessary. This makes your implementation lighter and often more directly under your control, which is especially valuable in tightly controlled environments or where every bit of performance is critical.

## OSI Model Explained

1. **What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?**  
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific function and communicates with the layers directly above and below it. Here’s a concise summary of each layer:

    1. Physical Layer:  
        - Function: Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium.
        - Components: Includes cables, jacks, patch panels, hubs, and other hardware that handle electrical or optical signals.
        - Role: Responsible for connections between devices, signal conversion, and data encoding.
    2. Data Link Layer:  
        - Function: Handles node-to-node data transfer and error detection/correction in the physical layer.
        - Components: Network interface cards (NICs), bridges, and switches.
        - Role: Responsible for framing, physical addressing, and controlling media access.
    3. Network Layer:  
        - Function: Manages device addressing, tracking, and packet routing between networks.
        - Components: Routers and layer 3 switches.
        - Role: Responsible for logical addressing and defining the best path for data transmission.
    4. Transport Layer:  
        - Function: Provides reliable data transfer across a network.
        - Components: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
        - Role: Manages end-to-end message delivery in the network, error recovery, and flow control.
    5. Session Layer:  
        - Function: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
        - Components: APIs and services that establish, manage, and terminate connections.
        - Role: Responsible for synchronizing dialogue between two hosts and managing their data exchange.
    6. Presentation Layer:  
        - Function: Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs.
        - Components: Encryption, compression, and conversion protocols.
        - Role: Translates data between the application layer and the network.
    7. Application Layer:  
        - Function: Provides networking services directly to applications.
        - Components: All end-user software such as web browsers, email clients, and other software that requires network access.
        - Role: Responsible for user interface and high-level protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP.

## TCP Handshakes Explained

1. **Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend**  
    1. Starting the Conversation: Imagine you want to start chatting with a friend online. First, your computer sends a signal saying, "Hey, can we talk?"
    2. Getting a Response: Your friend's computer responds with, "Yeah, let's talk, and I got your message."
    3. Confirming and Ready to Go: You then say, "Cool, I'm ready to chat now."  

    This three-step process is what computers do to set up a line of communication. It ensures that both sides are ready to send and receive information accurately, just like making sure both you and your friend are online and ready to start texting. Once this virtual handshake is done, they can start exchanging emails, loading web pages, or sending files.
