# 401 - Class 13 - Message Queues

## Why This Topic Matters

Message queues are a fundamental component in the architecture of many modern software systems, especially those that require reliability, scalability, and asynchronous processing. They serve as a critical mechanism for managing the flow of data between different parts of a system, often distributed across various services or applications.

## Socket.io Chat Example

1. **Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.**  
 It is like a mini program that lets people talk to each other over the internet in real time, similar to how texting works on your phone. It's built using several pieces of technology that work together to make sure messages can be sent, received, and seen by people chatting.  This system is like a community bulletin board that everyone can see and add messages to instantly, no matter where they are, as long as they have an internet connection.  

2. **What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?**  
    1. **Server Initialization:**  
      Each worker logs a message to the console when it starts listening on its assigned port. This log statement console.log(server running at http://\localhost:${port}); confirms that the server is up and listening.
    2. **Database Operations:**
      When a message is successfully inserted into the database, it emits the message back to all connected clients using io.emit('chat message', msg, result.lastID);. This action indicates that the backend is receiving, processing, and storing messages as expected.
      The application handles errors during database insertion, specifically catching SQLite constraint errors. If such an error is caught, it silently fails with an acknowledgment to retry, which implies robust error handling.  
    **3. Client Connections and Data Retrieval:**  
      On a new client connection, the server emits all previously stored messages to the connected client starting from the client's last known message. This is handled in the conditional block checking if (!socket.recovered) {...}.
      Messages are sent to individual sockets, which demonstrates that the server is managing state and client-specific contexts effectively.  
    **Real-time Interaction:**  
      The real-time nature of the application is evidenced by the socket.on('chat message', ...) event listener, which handles incoming messages and updates the database accordingly.

3. **Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?**  
    In Socket.IO, to send a message to every connected client except for the specific socket that's emitting the message, use the broadcast flag.

    ```javascript
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      socket.on('some event', (data) => {
        // This will emit to all connected clients except the one referenced by 'socket'
        socket.broadcast.emit('event to others', data);
      });
    });

    ```

## Rooms

1. **What is a room and how might a room be useful?**  
    In Socket.IO, a "room" is a concept that allows you to organize sockets into separate groups or namespaces for broadcasting and emitting events more selectively.  A room is a way to segment or group sockets based on any criteria you choose—commonly based on user interactions, features, or behaviors within your application. When a socket joins a room, it can receive messages that are specifically broadcast to that room, making it useful for sending data to multiple clients who are interested in the same topic or activity.

    Rooms are particularly useful in applications that require differentiated communication channels for different sets of users or contexts.

2. **How do you join a room?**  

    **Step 1: Set Up Your Server and Client**  
    First, ensure your Socket.IO server and client are properly set up and can communicate with each other.

    **Step 2: Emit an Event from the Client (Optional)**  
    Typically, the client will trigger an event to join a room. This could be done in response to a user action, like entering a chat room or starting a multiplayer game session.  

    ```javascript
    const socket = io(); // Assuming socket.io is already connected

    // Request to join a specific room
    socket.emit('join room', 'room1');
    ```

    **Step 3: Handle the Event on the Server**  
    On the server, you'll listen for the event (e.g., 'join room') and use the join() method to add the socket to the specified room.  

    ```javascript
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      // Listen for a join room request
      socket.on('join room', (roomName) => {
        socket.join(roomName);
        console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} has joined room: ${roomName}`);

        // Optionally notify others in the room
        socket.to(roomName).emit('new user', `A new user has joined the room: ${roomName}`);
      });
    });
    ```

    **Step 4: Broadcasting to the Room**  
    Once a socket has joined a room, you can send messages to all clients in that room using either socket.to(roomName).emit() for sending to others, or io.to(roomName).emit() to include the sender.

    Broadcasting to a room (excluding sender):

    ```javascript
      socket.to('room1').emit('message', 'Hello everyone in room1!');
    ```

    Broadcasting to a room (including sender):  

    ```javascript
      io.in('room1').emit('message', 'Hello everyone in room1, including sender!');
    ```

3. **How do you leave a room?**  
    **Step 1: Emit an Event from the Client (Optional)**  
    Typically, the client will trigger an event when it wants to leave a room. This might be a user action like clicking a "leave room" button or closing a chat window.

    Client-side code example:

    ```javascript
    const socket = io(); // Assuming socket.io is already connected

    // Request to leave a specific room
    socket.emit('leave room', 'room1');
    ```

    **Step 2: Handle the Event on the Server**  
    On the server, you listen for the leave request event (e.g., 'leave room') and use the leave() method to remove the socket from the specified room.

    Server-side code example:

    ```javascript
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      // Listen for a leave room request
      socket.on('leave room', (roomName) => {
      socket.leave(roomName);
      console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} has left room: ${roomName}`);

      // Optionally notify others in the room
      socket.to(roomName).emit('user left', `A user has left the room: ${roomName}`);
      });
    });
    ```

    **Step 3: Broadcasting to the Room after Leaving**  
    After a socket leaves a room, it can no longer send or receive messages from that room. However, you can still communicate with other sockets in that room from the server by using other socket connections that are still part of that room.

    **Additional Points:**  
    **Automatic Leaving:** Sockets automatically leave all rooms they’ve joined when they disconnect. If you want specific behavior upon disconnection, such as notifying other users, you should handle this in the disconnection event.  
    **Error Handling:** Always consider adding error handling around your socket operations to manage scenarios where socket operations might fail due to network issues.

    Disconnect Handling Example:

    ```javascript
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log(`Socket ${socket.id} disconnected.`);
        // Optionally handle cleanup or notifications here
      });
    });
    ```

## Namespaces

1. **What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?**  
    In Socket.IO, a Namespace is a concept that allows to segregate socket connections on the server into different paths or channels. This is useful for creating separate communication channels for different parts of tge application, each with its own logic and permissions.  It is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection

   It is essentially a server-side object that groups sockets together. Each namespace is identified by a path (usually prefixed with /). By default, all sockets in Socket.IO connect to the / namespace, but you can define and use additional namespaces as needed.

2. **Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)**  

    **Event handlers:**

    ```javascript
    io.of("/orders").on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.on("order:list", () => {});
      socket.on("order:create", () => {});
    });

    io.of("/users").on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.on("user:list", () => {});
    });
    ```

    **Rooms:**  

    ```javascript
    const orderNamespace = io.of("/orders");

    orderNamespace.on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.join("room1");
      orderNamespace.to("room1").emit("hello");
    });

    const userNamespace = io.of("/users");

    userNamespace.on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.join("room1"); // distinct from the room in the "orders" namespace
      userNamespace.to("room1").emit("holà");
    });
    ```

    **Middlewares:**  

    ```javascript
    const orderNamespace = io.of("/orders");

    orderNamespace.use((socket, next) => {
      // ensure the socket has access to the "orders" namespace, and then
      next();
    });

    const userNamespace = io.of("/users");

    userNamespace.use((socket, next) => {
      // ensure the socket has access to the "users" namespace, and then
      next();
    });
    ```

3. **Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces**  

    You want to create a special namespace that only authorized users have access to, so the logic related to those users is separated from the rest of the application.

    ```javascript
    const adminNamespace = io.of("/admin");

    adminNamespace.use((socket, next) => {
      // ensure the user has sufficient rights
      next();
    });

    adminNamespace.on("connection", socket => {
      socket.on("delete user", () => {
        // ...
      });
    });
    ```
