# 401 - Class 14 - Event Driven Architecture

## Objective

Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

## Idea(s)

I have already completed this lab.  I built a restaurant delivery service as described below:  
Build out a system that emulates a real world food delivery services. Restaurant Delivery Service will simulate a food delivery service where clients will place food order, restaurant receives and prepares order, driver is notified and picks up and delivers food. Once driver delivers food restaurant and client will be notified that their customers received food order purchase.

This will be an event driven application that “distributes” the responsibility for logging to separate modules, using only events to trigger logging based on activity.

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
To acquire a deeper understanding of Event Driven programming after having built project.
