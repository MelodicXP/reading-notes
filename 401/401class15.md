## Why This Topic Matters - Depth-First Traversal of trees

Depth-first traversal is crucial in computing because it allows for the systematic exploration of all possible paths within a data structure, making it essential for solving problems like navigating mazes or evaluating possible outcomes in game theory. It is efficient in managing tasks where understanding the sequence of actions and their consequences is required, such as syntax analysis in compilers or dependency resolution in software modules. Additionally, depth-first search is foundational for advanced algorithms in areas like network analysis, where finding connectivity and cycles are vital for understanding complex interactions within networks.

## Traversals

### Depth First

In computer terms, depth-first search (DFS) in trees works similarly. Starting from the root (the slide), DFS goes as deep as possible along one branch before backing up and exploring a new branch. It's like making sure you've explored everything possible in one direction before trying a different direction. This method helps ensure that no possibility is overlooked, which can be really useful for finding specific things in structured data, like a tree of decisions or categories.

There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. With these traversals, we rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the end of a sub-path.
