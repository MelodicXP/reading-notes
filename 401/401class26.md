# 401 - Class 26 - Component Based UI

## React Quick Start

1. **What are the building blocks of a React app?**  
      React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

      ```javascript
      function MyButton() {
        return (
          <button>I'm a button</button>
        );
      }
      ```

2. **What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?**
      React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

3. **What is JSX and why do we use it?**
      JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like \<br />. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a \<div>...\</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:

      ```javascript
      function AboutPage() {
        return (
          <>
            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>
          </>
        );
      }
      ```

4. **Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.**  
      Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display user.name:

      ```javascript
      return (
        <h1>
          {user.name}
        </h1>
      );
      ```

5. **Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?**
      In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:

      ```javascript
      let content;
      if (isLoggedIn) {
        content = <AdminPanel />;
      } else {
        content = <LoginForm />;
      }
      return (
        <div>
          {content}
        </div>
      );
      ```

6. **How does React know to respond to a user’s inputs?**
      You can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside your components:

      ```javascript
      function MyButton() {
        function handleClick() {
          alert('You clicked me!');
        }

        return (
          <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click me
          </button>
        );
      }
      ```

      Notice how onClick={handleClick} has no parentheses at the end! Do not call the event handler function: you only need to pass it down. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.

7. **What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?**
      Functions starting with use are called Hooks. useState is a built-in Hook provided by React.  You can only call Hooks at the top of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

8. **How can two react components share data?**
      You need to move the state from the individual component “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them.

## Render and Commit

1. **What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?**
      1. Triggering a render (delivering the guest’s order to the kitchen)
      2. Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
      3. Committing to the DOM (placing the order on the table)

2. **How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?**
      You can trigger further renders by updating its state with the set function. Updating your component’s state automatically queues a render. (You can imagine these as a restaurant guest ordering tea, dessert, and all sorts of things after putting in their first order, depending on the state of their thirst or hunger.)

3. **Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?**
      No, React only changes the DOM nodes if there’s a difference between renders.

4. **After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?**
      After rendering is done and React updated the DOM, the browser will repaint the screen. This process is known as “browser rendering”.

## Additional Questions

1. **Note the naming conventions in the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide. What pattern(s) do you see?**  
      * Component Naming: Components should be named using PascalCase, which means the first letter of each word is capitalized (e.g., MyComponent).
      * File Naming: Component file names should match the component name exactly, also using PascalCase (e.g., MyComponent.js).
      * Self-Closing Tags: Use self-closing tags for elements that do not have children (e.g., \<img />, \<br />).  

2. **Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
      I look forward to learning more about Sass and refreshing my memory again on front end work.

3. **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
      Increase proficiency with front-end development using Vite + React and Sass.
