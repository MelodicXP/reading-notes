# 401 - Class 28 - Reading: Component Lifecycle / useEffect Hook

## useEffect hook

1. **What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?**  
useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system. useEffect is a Hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. Side effects could be data fetching, setting up a subscription, or manually changing the DOM.

2. **How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?**

    The useEffect hook runs after component renders.  It interacts with component in the following ways.

    * Initial render - After componenet renders for the first time, the 'useEffect' callback runs.
    * Subsequent renders - If dependencies specified in the dependency array change, the 'useEffect' callback runs again.
    * Cleanup - If the effect has a clean up function, it runs before component unmounts and before the effect runs again (if dependencies change).

3. **What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?**  
The return value from the effect's logic function in useEffect is crucial for cleaning up resources, preventing memory leaks, and ensuring consistent behavior of your side effects. By returning a cleanup function, you can manage subscriptions, timers, or any other side effects that need to be cleaned up when the component unmounts or the dependencies change.

## What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

To learn as much as possible about how to use 'useEffect()' hooks and gain a deeper understanding of how they interact with componenets.
