## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

In a React application, managing the state of various components can get complex, especially as the app grows bigger. useReducer and useContext, can work together to make handling state easier. useReducer handles state changes in one place. It takes the current state and an action, then returns a new state based on that action. This keeps the logic of how the state changes in a centralized function.

useContext allows sharing of data across different components without having to pass props manually at every level. When useReducer and useContext are combined, managing state is simplified. useReducer handles how the state changes, and useContext makes that state available to any component that needs it, no matter where it is in the component tree.

Example:  
First, set up state and dispatch function with useReducer, which defines how state updates based on actions like "add", "delete", or "update".  

Then, use useContext to make this state and dispatch function available to any component that needs it. This way avoids the tedious task of passing state and functions through multiple levels of props. Instead, any component can access or update the state directly, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.
