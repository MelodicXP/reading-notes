## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

1. **What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?**  

    Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

    Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.

    As a result, lower-level employees usually do not have access to sensitive data if they do not need it to fulfill their responsibilities. This is especially helpful if you have many employees and use third-parties and contractors that make it difficult to closely monitor network access. Using RBAC will help in securing your company’s sensitive data and important applications.

2. **Share some examples of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.**

    Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

    * Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
    * Management role group – you can add and remove members.
    * Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
    * Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

3. **What are the Benefits of RBAC?**  
    Managing and auditing network access is essential to information security. Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis. With hundreds or thousands of employees, security is more easily maintained by limiting unnecessary access to sensitive information based on each user’s established role within the organization. Other advantages include:

    1. Reducing administrative work and IT support. With RBAC, you can reduce the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role. Instead, you can use RBAC to add and switch roles quickly and implement them globally across operating systems, platforms and applications. It also reduces the potential for error when assigning user permissions. This reduction in time spent on administrative tasks is just one of several economic benefits of RBAC. RBAC also helps to more easily integrate third-party users into your network by giving them pre-defined roles.
    2. Maximizing operational efficiency. RBAC offers a streamlined approach that is logical in definition. Instead of trying to administer lower-level access control, all the roles can be aligned with the organizational structure of the business and users can do their jobs more efficiently and autonomously.
    3. Improving compliance. All organizations are subject to federal, state and local regulations. With an RBAC system in place, companies can more easily meet statutory and regulatory requirements for privacy and confidentiality as IT departments and executives have the ability to manage how data is being accessed and used. This is especially significant for health care and financial institutions, which manage lots of sensitive data such as PHI and PCI data.

## Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. Yes, they are similarly named (react-cookie library & react-cookies component)

1. **Describe some react-cookie features.**

    * Cookie Handling: It allows you to set, get, and remove cookies in your React app easily.
    * Server-Side Rendering (SSR): This library supports SSR, making it useful for apps that need to render on the server before being sent to the client.
    * Hooks Integration: It provides hooks like useCookies to work with cookies in functional components.
  
2. **Describe some react-cookies component features.**

    * Cookie Management: Similar to the react-cookie library, it helps you manage cookies by setting, getting, and removing them.
    * Higher-Order Component (HOC): It offers a HOC to manage cookies in class components, making it easier to work with cookies without using hooks.
    * Lifecycle Methods: It integrates with React's lifecycle methods, allowing cookie changes to be managed within component lifecycles.

3. **Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?**

    react-cookie library. Here's why:

    * Hooks Support: Modern React development leans heavily towards functional components and hooks. The react-cookie library’s support for hooks makes it more suitable for current React practices.
    * Server-Side Rendering: Its support for SSR is a big plus if you’re working on an app that needs fast initial load times and SEO benefits.
    * Simplicity and Flexibility: With its straightforward API and flexible use in both client and server environments, it fits well into a wide range of projects.
