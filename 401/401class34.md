## Review API Server Build

1. **Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.**

    **Query string parameters** are a set of key-value pairs that are appended to the end of a URL. They are used to pass data to the server, typically for filtering or searching.

    Syntax: They appear after a question mark ? in the URL, with each parameter separated by an ampersand &.

    Example URL: <https://example.com/search?query=javascript&sort=asc>

    Usage:

    * In the URL above, query=javascript and sort=asc are query string parameters.
    * They are often used for optional data and filtering results.
    * They can be easily modified or added to a URL without changing the endpoint.

     **Path parameters** are part of the URL path itself and are used to identify specific resources. They are typically used to specify which resource you are interested in.  

     Example URL: <https://example.com/users/12345>

    * In the URL above, 12345 is a path parameter representing a specific user ID.
    * They are mandatory and form part of the URL structure.
    * They help in creating more readable and RESTful URLs.

2. **What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:**
    1. Domain: <http://our-site.com>
    2. v3
    3. model name: stuff
    4. id: things

    URL ---> **<http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things>**

    * <http://our-site.com> is the domain.
    * /v3 specifies the version of the API.
    * /stuff indicates the model name.
    * /things is the path parameter representing the specific ID of the resource.

3. **We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.**

    * An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a librarian.
    * When you ask the librarian (API) for a specific book (data), you give them details like the book's section (version), category (model name), and a special code (ID).
    * The librarian uses these details to find exactly what you need quickly.
    * This way, our system can get and give information smoothly, just like a librarian finding and handing you the right book.

## Review Auth Server Build

1. **Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.**  

    **Basic Auth:**

    * Middleware checks the Authorization header of incoming requests.
    * If the header starts with Basic, the middleware decodes the base64-encoded credentials.
    * It then verifies the username and password against the stored credentials before allowing access.

    **Bearer Auth:**

    * Middleware checks the Authorization header for a Bearer token.
    * It validates the token (usually a JWT) to ensure it's correct and not expired.
    * If valid, the middleware grants access to the requested resource.

2. **Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.**

    * The client (like an app) requests authorization from the user.
    * The user gives permission and the client receives an authorization code.
    * The client sends this code to the OAuth provider (like Google) to exchange it for an access token.
    * The OAuth provider validates the code and returns an access token, which the client can use to access the user's data securely.

3. **Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend**

    * RBAC is like different levels of access in a video game.
    * Depending on the role (like a player, moderator, or admin), you have different abilities.
    * For example, players can play the game, moderators can ban players, and admins can change game settings.
    * This way, everyone has just the right amount of control they need.
