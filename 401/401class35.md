## Graphs

### Vocabulary List

* **Graph:** A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges.
* **Vertex (Node):** A data point in a graph that can be connected to other vertices by edges.
* **Edge:** A line segment that connects two vertices in a graph.
* **Neighbor:** A vertex that is directly connected to another vertex via an edge.
* **Degree:** The number of edges connected to a vertex.
* **Undirected Graph:** A graph where edges have no direction, allowing bidirectional movement between vertices.
* **Directed Graph (Digraph):** A graph where each edge has a direction, indicating a specific path from one vertex to another.
* **Complete Graph:** A graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.
* **Connected Graph:** A graph where all vertices have at least one edge connecting them to another vertex.
* **Disconnected Graph:** A graph where some vertices are not connected by edges, potentially containing isolated vertices or "islands."
* **Acyclic Graph:** A directed graph without cycles, meaning no vertex can be revisited by traversing the graph.
* **Cyclic Graph:** A graph that contains cycles, where a vertex can be revisited by following the edges.
* **Adjacency Matrix:** A 2D array representing a graph, where rows and columns correspond to vertices, and elements indicate whether pairs of vertices are connected by edges.
* **Adjacency List:** A collection of lists or arrays where each list represents a vertex and contains a list of adjacent vertices.
* **Weighted Graph:** A graph where edges have associated numerical values, or weights, often representing costs or distances.
* **Breadth-First Traversal:** A graph traversal method that visits all vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.
* **Depth-First Traversal:** A graph traversal method that explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking and exploring other branches.
