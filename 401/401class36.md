# 401 - Class 36 - Application State with Redux

## Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials

1. **What is the first principle of Redux?**  
   The single immutable state tree. Everything that changes in your application, including the data and the UI state, is contained in a single object, we call the state or the state tree.

2. **What is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?**  

     Binds together the three principles of Redux. It holds the current application's state object. It lets you dispatch actions. When you create it, you need to specify the reducer that tells how state is updated with actions.

3. **Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.**
    * get state - It retrieves the current state of the Redux chore.
    * dispatch - It lets you dispatch actions to change the state of your application.
    * subscribe - It lets you register a callback that the Redux chore will call any time an action has been dispatched, so that you can update the UI of your application. It will reflect the current application state.

4. **Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.**  

    Think of a high school. The school has different departments, like Math, Science, and English. Each department has its own head who manages that department's activities and students. Now, the principal of the school needs a way to get a full report of how the entire school is doing, without having to check in with each department head individually all the time.

    In this case, each department head is like a "reducer" managing a part of the school's data (students, activities, etc.). The principal is like the main "reducer" who needs to combine information from all departments to see the overall performance of the school.

    Instead of the principal manually gathering information from each department head, they use a special tool, combineReducers(). This tool automatically combines reports from each department head into one complete school report.

    So, if the Math department head reports on math grades and the Science department head reports on science grades, combineReducers() will merge these reports into one report for the principal. This way, the principal can see the whole picture of the school's performance easily and efficiently.

    In summary, combineReducers() helps to combine multiple smaller reports (reducers) into one big report (main reducer), making it much easier to manage and understand the overall data.
