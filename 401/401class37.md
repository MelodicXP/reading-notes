# 401 - Class 37 - Redux - Combined Reducers

## Multiple Reducers Example

1. **Why create multiple reducers?**

    Creating multiple reducers helps keep code organized and easier to manage. Instead of having one large reducer handling everything, you can break it down into smaller pieces, each focusing on a specific part of the state. This makes it easier to maintain and understand.

2. **How would you combine multiple reducers?**  
    Combine multiple reducers using the combineReducers function from Redux. This function takes an object where each key is a piece of the state and each value is a corresponding reducer.

    ```javascript
    import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
    import userReducer from './userReducer';
    import tweetsReducer from './tweetsReducer';

    const rootReducer = combineReducers({
      user: userReducer,
      tweets: tweetsReducer,
    });

    export default rootReducer;
    ```

3. **How will you manage state as an immutable object? Why?**
    Manage state as an immutable object by always returning a new state object instead of modifying the existing one.

    ```javascript
    const newState = { ...state, name: action.payload };
    return newState;
    ```

## Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers

1. **combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ___ _____ .**  

    Redux reducers

2. **Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.**  
    There are two ways to define the initial shape and contents of your store's state. First, the createStore function can take preloadedState as its second argument. This is primarily intended for initializing the store with state that was previously persisted elsewhere, such as the browser's localStorage. The other way is for the root reducer to return the initial state value when the state argument is undefined.

3. **How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?**

    ```javascript
      // reducers.js
      export default theDefaultReducer = (state = 0, action) => state

      export const firstNamedReducer = (state = 1, action) => state

      export const secondNamedReducer = (state = 2, action) => state

      // rootReducer.js
      import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux'

      import theDefaultReducer, {
        firstNamedReducer,
        secondNamedReducer
      } from './reducers'

      // Use object literal shorthand syntax to define the object shape
      const rootReducer = combineReducers({
        theDefaultReducer,
        firstNamedReducer,
        secondNamedReducer
      })

      const store = createStore(rootReducer)
      console.log(store.getState())
      // {theDefaultReducer : 0, firstNamedReducer : 1, secondNamedReducer : 2}
    ```

## Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax

1. **Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?**  

    Organization, mantainability, separation of concerns, scalability, and testability.

2. **The _____ helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to ____.**  

    combineReducers, Redux Toolkit's configureStore

3. **What is a popular convention when naming reducers?**  
     Use the name of the piece of state they manage, followed by the word "Reducer." This convention makes it clear what part of the state each reducer is responsible for.
