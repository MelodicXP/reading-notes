# 401 - Class 38 - Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Async actions

1. **Why use Redux middleware?**
  In order to enable async logic.
2. **Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.**
  First eventHandler called, which dispatches an async operation (api call), then dispatch actions to the store/state.

3. **How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?**
  Using "Thunk" middleware.

## Thunk middleware

1. **Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?**  

    Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.

2. **Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.**  

    Function

3. **Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.**  
    Any return value from the inner thunk function can be made available by calling the thunk function and then using a promise to handle the returned value.
