Allows users to manage and track the books they've read, share reviews, and possibly discover new reads through recommendations. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to demonstrate CRUD operations with different levels of access.

#### 2. Inventory Management System

An API for managing inventory items in a store or warehouse. Different roles include Stock Clerk, Manager, and Auditor. Stock Clerks can add and update items, Managers can perform all operations, and Auditors can only view (read) inventory items.
