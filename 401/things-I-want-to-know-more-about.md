# Things I want to know more about

## Node Ecosystem

### Why this topic matters

**JavaScript Everywhere:**

Node.js extends the power of JavaScript, a language originally confined to web browsers. This unification of server-side and client-side scripting languages means developers can use JavaScript across the entire web development stack. This makes the development process more streamlined and efficient, as the same language is used for both front-end and back-end development.

**Asynchronous and Non-Blocking Nature:**

Node.js operates on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture. This means it can handle multiple operations simultaneously without blocking the main thread, leading to high-performance applications that can manage numerous simultaneous connections. This is particularly beneficial for real-time applications, like chat apps or live gaming.

**Scalability:**

Node.js is designed to be scalable, making it a preferred choice for companies that expect their applications to grow and handle increased loads over time. Its lightweight and efficient nature allows for handling of high volumes of connections with minimal resource usage.

### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node.js as a big tool that lets you run JavaScript outside of a web browser. Normally, JavaScript is used to make websites interactive and is run in a browser like Chrome or Firefox. But Node.js lets you use JavaScript for a bunch of other things, like creating applications on your computer.

### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

A "runtime" in programming is like an engine that reads and executes code. So, when we say Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, it means it's the engine that reads JavaScript code and makes it work (or 'run'). Node.js is special because it's built on the same engine that Google Chrome uses to run JavaScript on web pages, but it's adapted to run on servers and computers, not just in browsers.

### What is Node used for?

* Node.js is super versatile. People use it to build all sorts of things like websites, web applications, and even command-line tools. It's great for handling lots of tasks at the same time, which is handy for things like chatting apps where you get lots of messages from different people all at once.

* Developers also use Node.js to interact with databases, manage files on a server, or even control hardware like robots or drones.

### Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

At this point am not familiar with much of the information that will be taught.  My interest and gravitation towards certain aspects will be revealed to me as I progress through the journey of acquiring software development skills. Everything is interesting and useful!

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

The desired outcome is to gain and improve my software development skills while being exposed to different aspects in this field so that I can explore which avenues peak my interest.

## Prep: The Growth Mindset

### Read Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice. (10 minutes)

Emphasizes the importance of deliberate practice in improving technical skills in software development, stating that merely programming every day doesn't guarantee skill enhancement. It draws parallels with music practice, highlighting that effective improvement involves working on challenging aspects of a skill, rather than just repeating familiar tasks. A suggestion is setting specific, challenging, and repeatable goals that push developers outside their comfort zone, using examples like the Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind bioinformatics problems to illustrate effective learning strategies.

### Watch Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset. (10 minutes)

[Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

Emphasis on praising effort, focus, strategies, perseverance and improvement rather than intelligence or talent.  Using the words "not yet" gives greater confidence and a path into the future.

### Watch Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit. (6 minutes)

[Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

### Watch Alain de Botton on Redefining Success. (17 minutes)

[Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

Emphasizes the importance of empathy and not hastily judging others, as we often don't fully understand their true value or struggles.

It discusses the challenges of modern society, where uniformity and the pressure of envy can overshadow individuality, and highlights the inevitable aspect of not succeeding in every area of life.

The speaker points out that our definitions of success are often influenced by external factors, like societal norms and expectations from parents, leading us to pursue goals that might not genuinely align with our desires.

The key message is to introspect and ensure that our ambitions are authentically ours, acknowledging the uniqueness of our individual ideas of success and the importance of owning them.

### Assess your emotional intelligence
