# Class 8 - Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

An *'expression'* is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions:

* Those that have side effects (such as assigning values).  
**Example:** *' x = 7 '*  
This expression uses the '*=*' operator to assign the value seven to the variable *'x'*. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

* Those that purely evaluate.  
**Example:** *'3 + 4'*  
This expression uses the *'+'* operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7.

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

It offers a quick and easy to execute repeatedly.  Can write one piece of code to execute as many times as desired instead of manually writing code over and over.

## When does a for loop stop executing?

A '*for loop*' will stop executing once a condition evaluates to false.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

A '*while statement*' will execute its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
