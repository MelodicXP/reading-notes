# My Code Fellows Reading Journal

## Introduction

Hello my name is Carmelo Gonzalez.  I have a passion for all things tech related! I am very excited for the journey ahead with Code Fellows!

Here is a link to [my github portfolio](https://github.com/MelodicXP) (although at the moment there isn't much to look at yet!)

## Purpose of this site

This site serves as place to capture notes from Code Fellows coursework in a concise format so that they may be referenced easily at a later time if needed (i.e. cheat sheet).
