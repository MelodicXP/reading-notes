# My Code Fellows Reading Journal

## Introduction
Hello my name is Carmelo Gonzalez.  I have a passion for all things tech related! I am very excited for the journey ahead with Code Fellows!

Here is a link to [my github portfolio](https://github.com/MelodicXP) (although at the moment there isn't much to look at yet :sweat_smile:)

## What Growth Mindset Means to Me
Growth mindset to me is a state of being where one ***does the work required*** in order to achieve and grow towards the desired outcome.  Sometimes we get stuck getting ready to get ready, when all we really need is to just **DO** the things required that need **DOING** without overthinking it.  

***JUST DO*** and the progress will happen.  

### 3 ways to keep myself in a growth mindset. :muscle:

- Create **block time** dedicated to the desired outcomes, doing the work needed to move the needle.  For me that is waking up an extra hour earlier to get at it and making sure I get sufficient sleep the night before.

- Remember the **WHY**.  Everything I do is to support those that matter most to me in my life.

- Listen, take advice, and **ASK** for help from those further ahead on the journey that I am pursuing.
